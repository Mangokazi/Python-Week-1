# Python-Week-1
Day 1: INTRODUCTION AND ONBOARDING <br>
-We were taught how to install Python and Jupyter Notebook.<br>
-After installing the two we learnt about the use of neccessary prompts and ran a code on Jupyter.<br>
-I have also learnt that Jupyter is Python IDE(Integrated Development Environment).<br>
-Python may be used with any code editors, however, I will be using Jupyter Notebook.<br>
-There is a command that is used to access stored files which is, cd command. It is used to change directory.<br>

INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON:
 *Integers:
  -In this section I was struggling to understand an exercise on binary system and hexadecimal strings.
    Here is an example of the first problem I struggled with how my understand now:
     int('100', 2)
     Answer=4
     -He I struggled to understand were the four was coming from, however now iI do understand that in the binanry system, each digit 
      represents a power of 2. The first digit represents 2^0 which is 1, the next digit in the middle represents 2^1 which is 2, and the 
      last digit represents 2^2 which is 4.

      So the binary number which is 100 can be interpreted as:
       * 1 which is the first digit represents 2^2, which is equal to 4
       * 0 in the middle represents 2^1, which equal to 0, since it's multiplied by 0.
       * 0 in thelast digit represents 2^0, which is 1, since it's multiplied by 0.
         **Adding these up gives us: 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 , meaning 100 is equilavent to 4.
 -Second exercixe I struggled with under integers was this one:
    int('1ab', 16)
    *1ab is a hexadecimal string
    *16 is th base of specified for hexadecimal representation.

    *1 represents the value 1 in hex.
    *a represents the value 10 in hex.
    *b represents the value 11 in hex.
    *if we had another letter which was c, it would have hasd the value of 12.
