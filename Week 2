-When you invoke a function, Python remembers the place where it happened and jumps into the invoked function.
-The body of the function is then executed.
-Reaching at the end of the function forces Python to return to the place directly after the point of invocation.
 *Syntax:
   def  message():
     print("Enter next values:")
   print("We start here.")
   message()
   print("The end is here.")
